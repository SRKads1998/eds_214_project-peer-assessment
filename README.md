# Description

The project will consist of folders: 
- Documents - A folder containing any text files
- Figures - A folder containing any visuals and saved images 
- Data - A folder containing only raw data 
- Output - A folder that includes functions, any renderings, outfitted/cleaned data sets
- Scripts - A folder containing only scripts for cleaning/data wrangling
- Output - This will contain Quarto docs, supporting code for updated data, groupbys, graphing code
- Old - Will contain sandboxes for exploratory/spaghetti code
- R - A folder to house used functions

# Purpose
